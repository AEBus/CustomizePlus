### When will it be updated?
This plugin is being worked on when developers have free time and have a desire to do so, therefore update schedule does not exist. Real life and paid employment take priority over this project.

### IPC
Current IPC is mostly designed around it being used by Mare Synchronos, it is not recommended to rely on it. In the future general purpose IPC will be introduced with functionality better designed for usage by other plugins.
